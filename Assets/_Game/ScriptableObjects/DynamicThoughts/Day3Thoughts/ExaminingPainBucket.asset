  possibleThoughts:
  - The paint's still fresh. Always fresh. Like the memories I'm not supposed to
    have.
  - White paint to cover white walls. Why does it look pink when I stir it? Just
    tricks of the light.
  - The thickness feels wrong today. Too thick.
  - The fumes make me dizzy. Or maybe it's the scratching behind the walls. Paint.
    Must paint.
  - The paint remembers every color it's ever been. I hear them mixing.
