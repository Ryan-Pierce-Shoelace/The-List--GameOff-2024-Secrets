  possibleThoughts:
  - If only I could turn off so simply.
  - The voices didn't stop.
  - Why did you make me do this.
  - The silence is worse than the voices.
  - The last moments replay in the darkness.
  - The void behind the glass knows.
  - Empty screen. Empty house. Empty father.
  - I can see a little creature inside the glass. It is hunting me.
