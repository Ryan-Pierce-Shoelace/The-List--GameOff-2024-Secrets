  possibleThoughts:
  - Another mark... when did this get here?
  - The stain looks like a handprint today. Yesterday it was just a smudge
  - The list tells me to clean this stain. Again.
  - It's forming words now. But I cannot read them.
  - The mark pulses like a heart under wallpaper. Paint will still it. Paint must
    still it.
  - The mark whispers a lullaby I've never heard, but my hands remember singing it.
