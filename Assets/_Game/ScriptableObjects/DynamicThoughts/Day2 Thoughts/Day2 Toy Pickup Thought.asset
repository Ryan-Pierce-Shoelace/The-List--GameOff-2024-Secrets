  possibleThoughts:
  - I thought I already got rid of you
  - Looking at these still hurts
  - Joyful memories now rotten
  - I cant remember if this was their favorite
  - Without them the house is so quiet
  - How did this get here
  - This belongs with them
  - Its just a toy. No need to feel this way
