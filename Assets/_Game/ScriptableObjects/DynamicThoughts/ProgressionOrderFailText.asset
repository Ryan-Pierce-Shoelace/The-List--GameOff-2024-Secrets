  possibleThoughts:
  - One step at a time. Like the footsteps that live above.
  - Some tasks need to wait until their time.
  - Not yet. The list keeps us safe. It keeps us sane.
  - This comes later. Everything will come in due time..
  - I finished this task earlier, no need to do it again. Or did I?
  - Something is stopping me? But what.
