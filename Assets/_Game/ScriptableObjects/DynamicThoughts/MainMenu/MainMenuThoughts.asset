  possibleThoughts:
  - Another task. They appear when I am asleep
  - I don't remeber writing this one down.
  - The list is all that holds me together.
  - She used to make the lists. Not anymore.
  - They keep coming back.
  - The list helps me remember. It helps me to forget.
  - Some tasks repeat until they make sense
  - I should not look in the mirror.
  - The handwriting isn't mine.
  - Time moves differently when there is nothing on the list.
  - The medicine isn't working like it used to.
  - 'Check the locks... check the locks... '
  - Sometimes I think I can hear it.
  - Empty rooms can fill the pages.
  - Without the list, the memories would return.
  - The list knows what is and isn't real
  - Tasks complete me, and I complete them.
  - It needs me.
  - The List. The List. The List.The List.The List.The List.
  - It will inherit everything when I am gone
  - My hands shake without The List.
  - I think it has a list too....
  - Something is missing from my list.
