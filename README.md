**About the Game Off 2024 Game Jam**

This game was created as part of GitHub's Game Off 2024 game jam, where developers had one month to create a game based on the theme "SECRETS." As a small indie team, we wanted to explore the psychological aspects of control through everyday routines and lists.

The development process taught us valuable lessons about scope management and the power of subtle horror. We learned that sometimes the most unsettling experiences come from twisting the familiar rather than creating outright scares.

We did most of the work on this gamejam in a single weekend with a lot more polish after that, this pushed us to focus on core mechanics and atmospheric storytelling rather than complex features. 

The wildcards this year also really helped us find a tone for our project. Making everything black, white and grey really improved the atmosphere, and helped with getting an art style that felt cohesive. Special thansks to Shramper  https://shramper.itch.io/ for improving the player sprite
